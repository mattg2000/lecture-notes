# Snap Challenge: User Stories & Entities

Create a folder in your snap challenges project titled with 'snap-02' and create two pages, one for each question.

1. Mailchimp is a email newsletter mailing service for organizations that want to put out email newsletters to a list of subscribers.  They provide a lightweight image editor as part of their website.  Visit the page at https://mailchimp.com/help/upload-add-and-edit-images-in-campaigns/, pick one piece of functionality that they describe on that page,  and write a user story for it.  Remember, all user stories are of the form "As a _____ user, I can ______"

2. Create an ERD for this user story describing an action on an imaginary ecommerce site.  "As a registered user, I can add multiple shipping addresses to my profile."  Indicate which entities are strong, and which entities are weak.  Identify at least two attributes for each, including any primary or foreign keys.
