  - **front-end** - how the page looks and behaves
    - HTML, CSS, JavaScript and related technologies
    - Not the same as a designer!
  - **back-end** - transforming data between human-readable and machine-readable formats 
    - **Database** - where our data is stored
    - back-end language (PHP, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, many others)
- Bootcamp - 10 week intensive course
  - Expect homework
    - Almost 2/3 of our students from last cohort reported doing more than 10 hours per week outside of class.
    - Last three weeks are especially intense
  - We treat this like a professional environment, not a classroom
    - Accountability: first you, then peers, then instructors.
    - No personal attacks, rudeness, mocking, condescension, or other toxic interpersonal behavior.
  - Bring your whole self
    - Mental, emotional, and physical.
    - Transparency!  If we know what's going on, we can help.
    - Attendance and participation is mandatory - 50% of capstone
